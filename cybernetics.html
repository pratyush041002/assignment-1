<td> <strong>Cybernetics </strong> is a wide-ranging field concerned with regulatory and purposive systems. The core concept of cybernetics is circular causality or feedback—where the observed outcomes 
of actions are taken as inputs for further action in ways that support the pursuit and maintenance of particular conditions, or their disruption. <strong>Cybernetics </strong> is named after 
an example of circular causality, that of steering a ship, where the helmsperson maintains a steady course in a changing <u> environment by adjusting 
their steering in continual response to the effect it is observed as having </u> .  
<strong>Cybernetics</strong> is concerned with feedback processes such as steering however they are embodied, including in ecological, technological, biological, cognitive, and 
social systems, 
and in the context of practical activities such as designing, learning, managing, conversation, and the practice of cybernetics itself. <strong> Cybernetics'</strong> <em>transdisciplinary </em>,
and <em>"antidisciplinary" </em> character has meant that it intersects with a number of other fields, leading to it having both wide influence and diverse interpretations. </td>
